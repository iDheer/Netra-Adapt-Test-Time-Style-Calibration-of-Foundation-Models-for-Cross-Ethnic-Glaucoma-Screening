About Dataset
News: Now with a 10.0 Kaggle usability score: supplemental metadata.csv file added to dataset.

Overview:
This is an improved machine-learning-ready glaucoma dataset using a balanced subset of standardized fundus images from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS [1] set. This dataset is split into training, validation, and test folders which contain 4000 (~84%), 385 (~8%), and 385 (~8%) fundus images in each class respectively. Each training set has a folder for each class: referable glaucoma (RG) and non-referable glaucoma (NRG). This dataset is designed to easily benchmark your glaucoma classification models in Kaggle. Please make a contribution in the code tab, I have created a template to make it even easier!

Please cite the dataset and at least the first of my related works if you found this dataset useful!

Improvements from v1:

According to an ablation study on the image standardization methods applied to dataset v1 [3], images are standardized according to the CROP methodology (remove black background before resizing). This method yields more of the actual fundus foreground in the resultant image.
Increased the image resize dimensions from 256x256 pixels to 512x512 pixels
Reason: Provides greater model input flexibility, detail, and size. This also better supports the ONH-cropping models.
Added 3000 images from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS dev set
Reason: More data samples can improve model generalizability
Readjusted train/val/test split
Reason: The validation and test split sizes were different
Improved sampling from source dataset
Reason: v1 NRG samples were not randomly selected
Drawbacks of Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS:
One of the largest drawbacks of the original dataset is the accessibility of the dataset. The dataset requires a long download, a large storage space, it spans several folders, and it is not machine-learning-ready (it requires data processing and splitting). The dataset also contains raw fundus images in their original dimensions; these original images often contain a large amount of black background and the dimensions are too large for machine learning inputs. The proposed dataset addresses the aforementioned concerns by image sampling and image standardization to balance and reduce the dataset size respectively.

Origin:
The images in this dataset are sourced from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS [1] dataset, which contains 113,893 color fundus images from 60,357 subjects and approximately 500 different sites with a heterogeneous ethnicity; this impressive dataset is over 60GB when compressed. The first lightweight version of the dataset is known as EyePACS-AIROGS-light (v1) [2].

About Me:
I have studied glaucoma-related research for my computer science master's thesis. Since my graduation, I have dedicated my time to keeping my research up-to-date and relevant for fellow glaucoma researchers. I hope that my research can provide the necessary advancements to progress glaucoma detection methods.

Preprocessing Methodology:

1. Original Image



2. Visualize Intensity Map in 3D



3. Approximate the Segmentation of the Background and Foreground



4. Approximate Center of Segmentation Foreground



5. Approximate Radius of Segmentation Foreground from Radius



6. Crop the Minimal Bounding Square Around the Foreground



7. Resize to Desired Dimensions (ex. 512x512)



8. Apply Mask
